# Much - Your Git repos bulk command
Very useful script for keeping your Git repos in `~/Projects` clean and up-to-date.  
Looks for Git repositories and runs commands effectively (in parallel).

## Installation
`cp much /usr/local/bin`  
Please ensure you have `/usr/local/bin` in your `$PATH`

## Usage
`much`

## TODO
- Check remote updates and never worry about deleting your local repos again.
- Better output formatting.
- Add subcommands for checking: clean, branches, remotes, stashes
